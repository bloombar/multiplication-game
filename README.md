This is a simple game to help school kids practice their multiplication skills.

Two bubbles appear with random numbers inside of them, and the player must type the product of multiplying those two numbers, followed by the `ENTER` key, before the bubbles float off-screen. This process repeats and the numbers slowly become more difficult over time.
